Overview
========
The OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) CRS (Core Rule Set) for ModSecurity™ is an open source collection of rules that work with the ModSecurity™ WAF (Web Application Firewall). These rules were designed to provide easy to use, generic attack detection capabilities to your web application as part of a well balanced defence-in-depth solution.
